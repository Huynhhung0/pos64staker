# pos64 Staking Contest & Bug Hunt

KMDLabs is holding a testing and bug-hunting competition this Sunday, December 8, at 12:00 UTC. The competition will test and debug a new Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm that will be activated in the Komodo ecosystem on December 20, 2019. 

Shortly after 12:00 UTC on December 8, the LABS team will create a new test chain that uses the new PoS algorithm. The coins will be airdropped to all registered participants. Then the participants will start staking the test coins to test the new algorithm and accumulate as many block rewards as possible. The users with the highest test coin balances at the end of the testing period will receive awards. Additional bounties will be distributed to users who find bugs.

Itâ€™s recommended that participants use a Linux machine and are comfortable with GitHub.

## Contest Details

If 20 or more users participate, the LABS team will give away at least 1500 KMD and 10,000 LABS in prizes! 

1st place - 333 KMD and 7777 LABS

2nd place - 200 KMD and 2000 LABS

3rd place - 1000 LABS

Additional Bug Bounties - up to 1000 KMD and 10,000 LABS
